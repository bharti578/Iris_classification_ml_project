# Iris Classification using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a Machine Learning model that can accurately classify Iris flower species based on petal and sepal measurements.
It is one of the most popular beginner-friendly ML datasets and helps understand core concepts like data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

1) Project Overview

The goal of this project is to classify flowers into one of the following three species:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica

Using features from the dataset:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

The project includes full data preprocessing, EDA, model building, evaluation, and predictions.

2) Machine Learning Models Used

You can update this list based on your code.

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Each model is trained, compared, and evaluated using standard metrics.
